# Micro-cultures and finding your way

Most of work with people, often as a member of a team. We join a team because they are doing work that we are interested in, and we bring something valuable to the team. And as our careers progress, we work on good teams, bad teams, and hopefully great teams! But why did we enjoy these great teams and what made them unique and special? What do we miss about these teams that we sometimes struggle to recapture throughout the rest of our career?

In this talk, Mike McGarr (Slack Engineering) will try and answer this question by exploring the essence of organizational culture and how it impacts our work. Mike will also explore the micro-cultures that can exist within an organization that provide layers of influence into our lives and job satisfaction.
