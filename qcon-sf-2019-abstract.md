# Microcultures and finding your place

Finding a job that is a great fit can be challenging. In evaluating a potential job, each of us will inspect the opportunity from multiple angles concurrently. Does this particular role look interesting? Will it challenge and excite me? What about compensation? What are the growth opportunities? Can I meet my team? And, oh yeah, I need to make sure the culture of the company (and team) is a great fit. The role a company's culture(s) play in your overall job satisfaction can not be underestimated. So how do you go about finding the company culture of your dreams.

In this talk, Mike McGarr (Slack Engineering) will try and answer this question by exploring the essence of organizational culture and how it impacts our work. Mike will also explore the micro-cultures that can exist within an organization that provide layers of influence into our lives and job satisfaction.
