# Microcultures and finding your place

If you’ve worked for more than one company in your career, you know that culture can vary from one company to the next.  If you move from one team to another team within the same company, you may have observed that different teams within the same company have different cultures.  Why is that, and what does it mean for you?

In this talk, Mike McGarr (Slack Engineering) will try and answer this question by exploring the essence of organizational culture and how it impacts our work. Mike will also explore the microcultures that can exist within an organization that provide layers of influence into our lives and job satisfaction.
