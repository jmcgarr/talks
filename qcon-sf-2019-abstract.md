# Micro-cultures and finding your way

When you interview for a new job, most of us will ask questions in order to understand the job a bit more. Is this job a good fit for me? Often, your question about fit is just as much about the role as it is about the company. We all want to work in an environment where we feel comfortable. We all seek out an organizational culture that aligns with our personal values. But do most of know what to look for in a company?

In this talk, Mike McGarr (Slack Engineering) will try and answer this question by exploring the essence of organizational culture and how it impacts our work. Mike will also explore the micro-cultures that can exist within an organization that provide layers of influence into our lives and job satisfaction.
