# A newcomer's guide to culture

Joining a new organization isn't easy. A new team can often feel alien. Newcomers are expected to quickly assimilate, often into an environment that is only vaguely self-aware. Newcomers who are deemed successful are able to quickly understand and execute according to the new organization's expectations. Culture is one of the most impactful forces that will impact your job. So, if culture is so important to your success, do you know how to quickly assess it? Can you quickly gather an accurate understanding of an organization's culture?

In this talk, Mike McGarr (Slack Engineering) will explore techniques for understanding an organization's culture. Mike will share his perspective on organizational culture and how best to understand the forces at play in your everyday life.
